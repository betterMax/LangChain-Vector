The advantages of this approach is maintains a complete record of  the conversation, as well as being straightforward to implement and use. On the other hands, It can be less efficient as the conversation grows longer and may lead to excessive repetition if the conversation history is too long for the model's token limit.\r\n",

    "To manage this situation, you can adopt different strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Remove oldest messages\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to remove the oldest messages in the conversation transcript once the token count is reached. This method can cause the conversation quality to degrade over time, as the model will gradually lose the context of the earlier portions of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Limit conversation duration\n",
    "Another approach is to limit the conversation duration to the max token length or a certain number of turns. Once the max token limit is reached and the model would lose context if you were to allow the conversation to continue, you can prompt the user that they need to begin a new conversation and clear the messages array to start a brand new conversation with the full token limit available.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ConversationBufferWindowMemory Method:\n",
    "This method limits the number of tokens being used by maintaining a fixed-size buffer window that stores only the most recent tokens, up to a specified limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "→This is suitable for remembering recent interactions but not distant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ConversationSummaryBufferMemory Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method combines the features: of ConversationSummaryMemoryand ConversationBufferWindowMemory.\n",
    "It summarizes the earliest interactions in a conversation while maintaining the most recent tokens in their raw, information-rich form, up to a specified limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "→This allows the model to remember both distant and recent interactions but may require more tweaking on what to summarize and what to maintain within the buffer window.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to keep track of the token count and only send the model a prompt that falls within the token limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "→You can use OpenAI's tiktoken library to handle the token count efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Token limit:\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum token limit for the GPT-3.5-turbo model is 4096 tokens. This limit applies to both the input and output tokens combined. If the conversation has too many tokens to fit within this limit, you will have to truncate, omit, or shrink the text until it fits. Note that if a message is removed from the message's input, the model will lose all knowledge of it. \n",

    "→To handle this situation, you can split the input text into smaller chunks and process them separately or adopt other strategies to truncate, omit, or shrink the text until it fits within the limit. One way to work with large texts is to use batch processing. This technique involves breaking down the text into smaller chunks and processing each batch separately while providing some context before and after the text to edit.

By contrast,\\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\\nsoftware for all its users.\\n\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\\n\\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\\nand/or modify the software.\\n\\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users\\' freedom is that\\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\\nsource code to the public.\\n\\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\\ncode of the modified version.\\n\\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\\nthis license.\\n\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\nmodification follow.\\n\\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n  0. Definitions.\\n\\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\\n\\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\\n\\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\\n\\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\\n\\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\\non the Program.', metadata={'source': './the-algorithm\\\\COPYING'})"
